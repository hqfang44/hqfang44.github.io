Hi! I'm an undergraduate student and researcher at the University of Washington. I double major in Computer Science and Statistics, with a minor in Mathematics. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) at the [Information Processing Lab](https://ipl-uw.github.io/) in UW ECE, and co-advised by Professor [Ranjay Krishna](https://www.ranjaykrishna.com/) at the [RAIVN Lab](https://raivn.cs.washington.edu/) and Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) at the [Robotics and State Estimation Lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) in UW CSE. I am also pleased to collaborate with Dr [Ying Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MNrLDhwAAAAJ/) and Dr [Jiafei Duan](https://duanjiafei.com/). 

My research interests are broadly in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am especially passionate about vision-language pretraining, multimodal learning, representation learning, diffusion model, and their applications in robotics and biomedicine.
